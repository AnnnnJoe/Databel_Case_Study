# CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS - DATABEL CASE STUDY
### Project Overview
This project investigates customer churn rates for Databel, a fictional telecom company, using Power BI. The goal was to identify patterns, uncover key churn drivers, and recommend data-driven strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
### Key Insights
- Churn Rate: 26.86% of customers have churned.
- Top Churn Reason: Competitor (44.82% of churned customers).
- Geographic Insight: California (CA) shows the highest churn rate at 63.24%.
- Demographics: Seniors have the highest churn rate (38.46%), and churn increases with age.
- Group Contracts: Customers not part of a group contract churn more.
- Contract Type: Monthly contracts face higher churn compared to yearly contracts.
- Unlimited Data Plan: Customers with unlimited plans churn more than those without.
- International Plan: Highest churn is among customers who have an international plan but don’t actively use it.
- Account Length: Churn decreases as customer tenure increases.
### Tools & Techniques
- Power BI → Data visualization & dashboarding.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) → Custom measures (churn rate, customer segments, groupings).
- Data Modeling → Categorized demographics, contract types, consumption groups for deeper analysis.
### Recommendations
1. Incentivize customers to switch from monthly to yearly contracts.
2. Reassess unlimited and international plan structures to better align with customer needs.
3. Enhance customer loyalty programs for senior customers and long-tenure groups.
4. Investigate and resolve regional issues in California where churn is highest.
5. Strengthen competitive positioning through improved service offerings and customer engagement.
### Conclusion
This case study demonstrates how business intelligence tools can uncover actionable insights from customer data. By addressing the identified churn drivers, Databel can significantly improve retention, reduce revenue leakage, and build stronger long-term customer relationships.
